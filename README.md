# FDA Warning Letter Analysis: Root Cause Investigation Deficiencies in Medical Device Manufacturing

An open analysis of FDA Warning Letters issued to medical device manufacturers and CDMOs, quantifying how frequently inadequate root cause analysis is cited as a regulatory violation.

## Why This Matters

Root cause analysis failures don't just trigger regulatory action—they indicate systemic issues in how manufacturers investigate and prevent quality problems. When the FDA cites inadequate root cause investigation, it means:

- Defects are being addressed symptomatically, not fundamentally
- The same failures are likely to recur
- Patient safety risks remain unresolved

This analysis quantifies the scale of the problem.
